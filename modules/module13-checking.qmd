# Module 13: Model Checking and Criticism

This module focuses on tools for assessing the adequacy of Bayesian models: posterior predictive checks, sensitivity to priors, prior elicitation, and robustness analyses.

## 1. Posterior Predictive Checks

### 1.1 Posterior Predictive Distribution

Given data \(x\), prior \(\Pi\), and likelihood \(p(x \mid \theta)\), the **posterior predictive distribution** for replicated data \(X_{\text{rep}}\) is
5959
 p(x_{\text{rep}} \mid x) = \int p(x_{\text{rep}} \mid \theta) \, \Pi(d\theta \mid x).
5959

### 1.2 Test Statistics and Discrepancy Measures

Choose a test statistic or discrepancy function \(T(x, \theta)\) capturing aspects of the data or model of interest (e.g., tail behavior, dispersion).

The posterior predictive p-value is
5959
 p_{\text{ppc}} = \mathbb{P}( T(X_{\text{rep}}, \theta) \ge T(x, \theta) \mid x ),
5959
where the probability is with respect to the joint posterior predictive distribution of \((X_{\text{rep}}, \theta)\).

### 1.3 Interpretation

Posterior predictive p-values close to 0 or 1 indicate potential model misfit along the chosen dimension. They are not uniform under the null and tend to be conservative.

## 2. Sensitivity to Priors and Bayesian Robustness

### 2.1 Local Sensitivity

Consider posterior expectations \(\mathbb{E}_\Pi[g(\theta) \mid x]\) as functions of prior hyperparameters \(\eta\). Local sensitivity analysis studies derivatives
5959
 \frac{\partial}{\partial \eta} \mathbb{E}[g(\theta) \mid x; \eta].
5959

These derivatives can be expressed in terms of posterior covariances between \(g(\theta)\) and score functions of the prior.

### 2.2 Global Sensitivity and Robust Priors

- **\(\varepsilon\)-contamination priors:**
  5959
   \Pi_\varepsilon = (1-\varepsilon) \Pi_0 + \varepsilon Q,
  5959
  where \(Q\) represents a contaminating distribution.
- Study the range of posterior summaries as \(\varepsilon\) varies, assessing robustness to prior perturbations.

### 2.3 Robustness Criteria

Robustness can be assessed via:

- Bounded influence of prior tails on posterior summaries,
- Stability of posterior in Kullback–Leibler neighborhood of the prior,
- Existence of worst-case priors within specified classes.

## 3. Prior Elicitation

### 3.1 Principles

Prior elicitation aims to translate substantive knowledge or beliefs into a prior distribution. Strategies include:

- Matching prior moments or quantiles to expert judgments,
- Using conjugate priors with interpretable hyperparameters (e.g., pseudo-count interpretations),
- Ensuring that elicited priors place reasonable mass on plausible parameter regions.

### 3.2 Elicitation in Conjugate Models

In Beta–Binomial, interpret \((\alpha, \beta)\) as prior success and failure counts. In Normal–Normal models, interpret prior mean and variance as prior guess and uncertainty about the parameter.

## 4. Example: Overdispersion in Poisson Models

Consider \(X_i \mid \lambda \sim \operatorname{Poisson}(\lambda)\) with Gamma prior on \(\lambda\).

- Use posterior predictive checks to assess whether data are overdispersed relative to the Poisson assumption.
- Compare observed variance to posterior predictive variance.
- If overdispersion is detected, consider alternative models (e.g., Negative Binomial) or hierarchical extensions.

## 5. Problem Set 13 (Representative Problems)

1. **Posterior Predictive Check for Poisson.** For a Poisson–Gamma model, derive the posterior predictive distribution and construct a test statistic sensitive to overdispersion. Analyze how the posterior predictive p-value behaves when data are generated from an overdispersed process.

2. **Local Sensitivity Derivative.** Let the prior density be \(\pi(\theta \mid \eta)\). Derive an expression for \(\partial/\partial \eta\, \mathbb{E}[g(\theta) \mid x; \eta]\) in terms of posterior expectations and derivatives of \(\log \pi(\theta \mid \eta)\).

3. **\(\varepsilon\)-Contamination Analysis.** Implement an \(\varepsilon\)-contamination analysis in a simple Normal model with unknown mean and known variance. Study how posterior means and credible intervals change as \(\varepsilon\) varies.

4. **Robust Prior Construction.** Propose a heavy-tailed prior for a location parameter (e.g., Cauchy) and analyze its robustness properties compared to a Normal prior, particularly in the presence of outliers.

5. **Prior Elicitation Exercise.** In a Beta–Binomial context, suppose an expert believes the success probability lies between 0.3 and 0.7 with high probability and that 10 pseudo-observations are appropriate. Derive hyperparameters \((\alpha, \beta)\) consistent with these beliefs and discuss the resulting prior density.
