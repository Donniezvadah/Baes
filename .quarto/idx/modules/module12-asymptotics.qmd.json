Posterior Consistency\n\n### 1.1 Setup\n\nLet \\(X_1, X_2, \\dots\\) be i.i.d. from a distribution \\(P_{\\theta_0}\\) in a model \\(\\{P_\\theta : \\theta \\in \\Theta\\}\\). Let \\(\\Pi\\) be a prior on \\(\\Theta\\), and \\(\\Pi(\\cdot \\mid X_1, \\dots, X_n)\\) the posterior.\n\n### Definition 12.1 (Posterior Consistency) {#def-posterior-consistency}\n\nThe posterior is **(weakly) consistent** at \\(\\theta_0\\) if for every weak neighborhood \\(U\\) of \\(\\theta_0\\),\n$$\n \\Pi(U^c \\mid X_1, \\dots, X_n) \\to 0\n$$\n\\(P_{\\theta_0}\\)-almost surely as \\(n \\to \\infty\\).\n\nStronger modes of consistency (e.g., in total variation or Hellinger distance) can also be defined.\n\n### 1.2 Kullback–Leibler Support and Schwartz's Theorem\n\nDefine the Kullback–Leibler divergence\n$$\n K(P_{\\theta_0}, P_\\theta) = \\int \\log \\frac{p_{\\theta_0}(x)}{p_\\theta(x)} \\, P_{\\theta_0}(dx).\n$$\n\n### Theorem 12.2 (Schwartz's Theorem, Informal) {#thm-schwartz}\n\nIf the prior \\(\\Pi\\) assigns positive mass to all Kullback–Leibler neighborhoods of \\(\\theta_0\\), i.e.,\n$$\n \\Pi\\big(\\{\\theta : K(P_{\\theta_0}, P_\\theta) < \\varepsilon\\}\\big) > 0 \\quad \\forall \\varepsilon > 0,\n$$\nthen the posterior is weakly consistent at \\(\\theta_0\\) under suitable measurability and separability conditions.\n\n*Idea of proof:* Fix a neighborhood \\(U\\) of \\(\\theta_0\\) and consider its complement \\(U^c\\). For suitable subsets of \\(U^c\\), construct uniformly consistent hypothesis tests separating \\(\\theta_0\\) from those alternatives. The Kullback–Leibler support condition guarantees that the prior assigns positive mass to small KL-neighborhoods around \\(\\theta_0\\), which control likelihood ratios via the law of large numbers. Combining these ingredients, one shows that the posterior mass of \\(U^c\\) must vanish almost surely under \\(P_{\\theta_0}\\) as \\(n \\to \\infty\\). A rigorous proof uses coverings of \\(U^c\\), existence of tests with exponentially decaying type II error, and exponential bounds on marginal likelihood ratios.\n\n## 2. Misspecified Models\n\n### 2.1 Pseudo-True Parameter\n\nIf the true distribution \\(P_0\\) is not in the model \\(\\{P_\\theta\\}\\), the posterior may still concentrate around a **pseudo-true parameter** \\(\\theta^*\\) defined as\n$$\n \\theta^* \\in \\arg\\min_{\\theta \\in \\Theta} K(P_0, P_\\theta).\n$$\n\n### Theorem 12.3 (Posterior Concentration under Misspecification, Informal) {#thm-misspecification}\n\nUnder regularity conditions, the posterior concentrates in neighborhoods of \\(\\theta^*\\), i.e., for any neighborhood \\(U\\) of \\(\\theta^*\\),\n$$\n \\Pi(U^c \\mid X_1, \\dots, X_n) \\to 0\n$$\n\\(P_0\\)-almost surely as \\(n \\to \\infty\\).\n\n*Idea of proof:* Replace \\(P_{\\theta_0}\\) by the true distribution \\(P_0\\) and work with the pseudo-true parameter \\(\\theta^*\\) minimizing \\(K(P_0, P_\\theta)\\). Under regularity conditions ensuring existence and local uniqueness of \\(\\theta^*\\), likelihood ratios still obey a law of large numbers with limit given by KL-divergence. One then constructs tests separating neighborhoods of \\(\\theta^*\\) from distant alternatives (in terms of KL or Hellinger distance) and shows, via generalized likelihood ratio bounds and prior mass conditions near \\(\\theta^*\\), that the posterior probability assigned to sets bounded away from \\(\\theta^*\\) tends to zero \\(P_0\\)-almost surely.\n\n## 3. Posterior Contraction Rates\n\n### 3.1 Definition\n\nLet \\(d\\) be a metric on \\(\\Theta\\) (e.g., Hellinger distance between \\(P_\\theta\\) and \\(P_{\\theta_0}\\)). A sequence \\(\\varepsilon_n \\to 0\\) is a **contraction rate** if there exists a sequence of sets \\(B_n\\) such that\n$$\n \\Pi(B_n^c \\mid X_1, \\dots, X_n) \\to 0\n$$\n\\(P_{\\theta_0}\\)-almost surely and\n$$\n B_n \\subseteq \\{\\theta : d(\\theta, \\theta_0) \\le M \\varepsilon_n\\}\n$$\nfor some constant \\(M\\).\n\n### 3.2 Sufficient Conditions\n\nGhosal, Ghosh, and van der Vaart give general sufficient conditions for contraction at rate \\(\\varepsilon_n\\):\n\n1. Existence of tests separating \\(\\theta_0\\) from \"far\" alternatives.\n2. Prior mass condition: \\(\\Pi\\) assigns enough mass to Kullback–Leibler neighborhoods of \\(\\theta_0\\) of size \\(\\varepsilon_n\\).\n3. Entropy conditions on the model complexity.\n\nIn parametric models, the typical rate is \\(\\varepsilon_n = n^{-1/2}\\); in nonparametric models, slower rates occur.\n\n## 4. Frequentist Coverage of Bayesian Procedures\n\n### 4.1 Bernstein–von Mises Revisited\n\nIn regular finite-dimensional parametric models, the Bernstein–von Mises theorem implies that posterior credible sets asymptotically behave like frequentist confidence sets.\n\n### 4.2 Coverage Issues in Nonparametric and High-Dimensional Settings\n\nIn more complex models, Bayesian credible sets may:\n\n- undercover (actual frequentist coverage < nominal),\n- overcover (conservative),\n- or have shape properties (e.g., adaptivity) that do not align with standard frequentist intervals.\n\nAnalyses of coverage require detailed control of posterior contraction, shape of posterior distributions, and prior influence.\n\n## 5.
