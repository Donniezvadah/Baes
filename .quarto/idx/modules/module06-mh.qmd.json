Construction of the Metropolis–Hastings Kernel\n\n### 1.1 Target and Proposal\n\n- State space: \\((\\mathsf{X}, \\mathcal{X})\\).\n- Target distribution: probability measure \\(\\pi\\) on \\((\\mathsf{X}, \\mathcal{X})\\), with density (possibly unnormalized) \\(\\pi(x)\\) w.r.t. a reference measure \\(\\mu\\).\n- Proposal kernel: \\(q(x, dy)\\), with density \\(q(x,y)\\) w.r.t. \\(\\mu\\).\n\n### 1.2 Acceptance Probability\n\nDefine the acceptance probability\n5959\n \\alpha(x,y) = \\min\\left\\{ 1, \\frac{\\pi(y) q(y,x)}{\\pi(x) q(x,y)} \\right\\}\n5959\nwhen the ratio is well-defined and positive. On sets where \\(\\pi(x) q(x,y) = 0\\), define \\(\\alpha(x,y)\\) appropriately (e.g., 0) to obtain a measurable function.\n\n### 1.3 MH Transition Kernel\n\nThe Metropolis–Hastings transition kernel is\n5959\n K(x, dy) = q(x, dy) \\alpha(x,y) + r(x) \\, \\delta_x(dy),\n5959\nwhere\n5959\n r(x) = 1 - \\int_\\mathsf{X} q(x, dy) \\alpha(x,y)\n5959\nensures that \\(K(x, \\cdot)\\) is a probability measure. Here, \\(\\delta_x\\) denotes the Dirac measure at \\(x\\).\n\n## 2. Detailed Balance and Stationarity\n\n### Theorem 6.1 (Detailed Balance for MH)\n\nAssume that \\(q(x,y) > 0\\) whenever \\(\\pi(x) \\pi(y) > 0\\). Then the MH kernel \\(K\\) satisfies detailed balance with respect to \\(\\pi\\):\n5959\n \\pi(dx) K(x, dy) = \\pi(dy) K(y, dx).\n5959\nIn particular, \\(\\pi\\) is invariant for \\(K\\).\n\n*Proof:* For \\(x \\neq y\\),\n5959\n \\pi(dx) K(x, dy) = \\pi(dx) q(x, dy) \\alpha(x,y),\n5959\n5959\n \\pi(dy) K(y, dx) = \\pi(dy) q(y, dx) \\alpha(y,x).\n5959\nBy construction,\n5959\n \\pi(x) q(x,y) \\alpha(x,y) = \\min\\{ \\pi(x) q(x,y), \\pi(y) q(y,x) \\}\n5959\nand similarly\n5959\n \\pi(y) q(y,x) \\alpha(y,x) = \\min\\{ \\pi(y) q(y,x), \\pi(x) q(x,y) \\}.\n5959\nHence these expressions are equal, implying detailed balance for off-diagonal transitions. The diagonal part ensures normalization and is automatically symmetric when integrated over sets. Therefore, detailed balance holds, and invariance follows by Lemma 5.3.\n\n## 3. Irreducibility, Aperiodicity, and Convergence\n\n### 3.1 Irreducibility\n\nIf the proposal kernel \\(q\\) is \\(\\nu\\)-irreducible on the support of \\(\\pi\\) (for some nontrivial \\(\\nu\\)) and proposals are accepted with positive probability wherever \\(\\pi>0\\), then the MH chain is \\(\\pi\\)-irreducible.\n\n### 3.2 Aperiodicity\n\nMH chains are typically aperiodic provided there is a nonzero probability of remaining at the current state (e.g., via rejection). The self-transition probability \\(r(x)\\) ensures aperiodicity under mild conditions.\n\n### Theorem 6.2 (Convergence to Stationarity)\n\nUnder irreducibility, aperiodicity, and positive recurrence, the MH chain converges in distribution to \\(\\pi\\): for any initial distribution \\(\\mu_0\\),\n5959\n \\| \\mu_0 K^n - \\pi \\|_{\\text{TV}} \\to 0 \\quad \\text{as } n \\to \\infty.\n5959\n\nMoreover, if suitable drift and minorization conditions hold, the convergence is geometric, and ergodic theorems and CLTs apply.\n\n## 4. Optimal Scaling in High Dimensions\n\nConsider a sequence of target distributions \\(\\pi_d\\) on \\(\\mathbb{R}^d\\), e.g., i.i.d. product measures, and random-walk MH with Gaussian proposals of the form\n5959\n Y = X + \\sqrt{\\frac{\\ell^2}{d}} Z, \\quad Z \\sim N_d(0, I_d).\n5959\n\n### Theorem 6.3 (Informal Optimal Scaling Result)\n\nUnder suitable regularity conditions (e.g., target is product of i.i.d. components with smooth log-density), the rescaled MH chain converges to a diffusion as \\(d \\to \\infty\\). The **optimal acceptance rate** maximizing the speed of this limiting diffusion is approximately\n5959\n \\alpha^* \\approx 0.234.\n5959\n\n*Idea of proof:* Show weak convergence of the interpolated chain to a Langevin diffusion and optimize the diffusion speed with respect to \\(\\ell\\).\n\n## 5. Pathologies and Failure Modes\n\n### 5.1 Poorly Tuned Proposals\n\n- **Step size too small:** High acceptance rate but extremely slow exploration (high autocorrelation).\n- **Step size too large:** Very low acceptance rate, many rejections, and poor mixing.\n\n### 5.2 Ill-Conditioned or Multimodal Targets\n\n- Targets with strong correlations or narrow ridges lead to slow mixing of isotropic random-walk proposals.\n- Multimodal targets may trap the chain in one mode for long periods.\n\n### 5.3 Heavy-Tailed Targets\n\nFor targets with heavy tails, random-walk MH may fail to be geometrically ergodic, complicating convergence diagnostics and CLTs.\n\n## 6.
